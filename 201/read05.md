## Images
* The ```<img>``` element is used to add images to a web page.
* To add an image into the page you need to use an ```<img>``` element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag).
* **src** This tells the browser where it can find the image file.
* **title** You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image.
* **height** This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
* **width** This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
* **align** The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.
* **Animated GIFs** Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
* **figure** Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new ```<figure>`` element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
*  **figcaption** The ```<figcaption>``` element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.

## Color
#### The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.
* **RGB values** These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. ```color: rgb(red,green,blue);```
* **HEX codes** These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. ```color: #eeeeee; ```
* **color names** There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.```color: Color_Name;``
* **background-color** CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box. ```background-color: #eeeeee;```
* The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. ```background-color: hsl(0,0%,100%);```
* The hsla color property allows you to specify color properties using hue, saturation, and lightness as above, and adds a fourth value which represents transparency ```background-color: hsla(0,100%,100%,0.5);```


## Text
* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing. 
* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
