## IMAGES
* Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.
* You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.
* Rather than using the `<img>` element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images.
* By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text.
* The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.
* Repeating Images The background-repeat property can have four values: repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, no-repeat.
* The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property. 
* Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.
* You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

## Practical Information
* Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.

* To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
* Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
