**Key Concepts in Positioning Elements**
*  Normal Flow ```position:static``` each block-level element sits on top of the next one.
* Relative Positioning ```position:relative```  Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.
* Absolute Positioning ```position:absolute``` When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.
* Fixed Positioning ```position:fixed``` Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.
* Overlapping Elements ```z-index``` When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap.
* Floating Elements ```float``` The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
* Clearing Floats ```clear``` The clear property allows you to say that no element (within the same containing element)  
* Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
* Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
* The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.
* CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.
