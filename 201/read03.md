## Lists
**There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists**
* **Ordered lists** ```<ol>``` are lists where each item in the list is numbered.
* **Unordered lists** ```<ul>``` are lists that begin with a bullet point.
* **Definition lists** ```<dl>``` are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.


## Boxes
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.
## ARRAYS is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
 * Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list, the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
 * Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index.
 * To retrieve the third item on the list, the array name is specified along with the index number in square brackets.
 * Each array has a property called length, which holds the number of items in the array.
## Loops:
### It is a programming statement to repeat a specific event based on a condition that must be met in order to executing what is inside this loop
* for loops ```for (i=start point;Condition; increment ){ do something }```
* while Loops ``` while (condition){do something ; make a change on parameters of the condition }```
