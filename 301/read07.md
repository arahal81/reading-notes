## REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
    * He is a guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet and then he did a ton of research explaining why the
      web works the way it does.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    * Because the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't
      nearly as useful or eloquent, known as SOAP.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    * The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
4. What does a `GET` do?
    * Each system would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET.
5. What does a `POST` do?
    * The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource 
      identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.
6. What does `PUT` do?
    * If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

    *  partially updates the data in a system from another system.
