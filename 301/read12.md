1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|                                    SQL                                                      |                                          NoSQL                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)                         |  NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database              |
|           SQL databases are table based databases                                           |  NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
|                      SQL databases have predefined schema                                   |                 NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data                   |
|                      SQL databases are vertically scalable                                  |                  NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable                                  |
| SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data |                  NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents             |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    * data is highly structured ,we use it to store customer orders and product records
2. Give a real world example.
    * Database for Hospital
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    * NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.
4. Give a real world example.
    * Facebook Database
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    * NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    * In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.
