## Intro to Django

- What is Django ? Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.

## Templates

Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

## Forms

Django has a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types, it also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

## Authentication

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

## Admin

Django offers an admin interface that content procedures can immediatly use to start managing content on your site.

## Internationalization

Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize Web applications for particular users according to their preferences.
