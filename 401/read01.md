## Big O Notation

- Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

## Logarithms

- This type of algorithm is described as O(log N).
  As complexity is often related to divide and conquer algorithms, O(log(n)) is generally a good complexity you can reach for sorting algorithms. O(log(n)) is less complex than O(âˆšn), because the square root function can be considered a polynomial, where the exponent is 0.
