## Trees

- Trees consists of nodes which are connected with each other.
- Common Terminology for Trees:
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes.
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree.
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree.
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree.
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node.
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children.
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## Traversals

- An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node:
  - Depth First
  - Breadth First

## Binary Trees

- Binary Search Trees is exists when nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.
- strategy for adding a new node to a binary tree is to fill all “child” spots from the top down. To do so, we would leverage the use of breadth first traversal. During the traversal, we find the first node that does not have 2 child nodes, and insert the new node as a child. We fill the child slots from left to right.

## Big O

The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n). Because of the lack of organizational structure in a Binary Tree, the worst case for most operations will involve traversing the entire tree. If we assume that a tree has n nodes, then in the worst case we will have to look at n items, hence the O(n) complexity.
