## Linear Regressions

- linear regression is a popular technique and you might as well seen the mathematical equation of linear regression.
- we can use numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn for linear regression. however, Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning.

### When Do we Need Regression?

Typically, we need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related

### Scikit Learn

  In this section I am going to fit a linear regression model and predict the Boston housing prices. I will use the least squares method as the way to estimate the coefficients.

  - Y = boston housing price(also called “target” data in Python)
  - X = all the other features (or independent variables)

- Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:
  - fit() fits a linear model
  - predict() Predict Y using the linear model
  - score() Returns the coefficient of determination
