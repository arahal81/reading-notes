## Data Science Primer

**_What makes machine learning so special?_**

- Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

### Key Terminology

| Term            | Meaning                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Model           | a set of patterns learned from data                        |
| Algorithm       | a specific ML process used to train a model                |
| Training data   | the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model      |
| Test data       | a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance    |
| Features        | Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model |
| Target variable | A specific variable you're trying to predict               |
| Observations    | Data points (rows) in the dataset                          |

### Machine Learning Tasks

- In applied machine learning, you should first pick the right machine learning task for the job (A task is a specific objective for your algorithms).
  - Supervised Learning : includes tasks for "labeled" data (i.e. you have a target variable).
  - Unsupervised Learning : includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).

### Feature Engineering:

- In a nutshell, “feature engineering” is creating new model input features from your existing ones.

- `Applied machine learning` is basically feature engineering.

### Data Cleaning

- Data cleaning is one those things that everyone does but no one really talks about. Sure, it’s not the "sexiest" part of machine learning. And no, there aren’t hidden tricks and secrets to uncover.

### Model Training:

- Data scientists actually do spend most their time on the earlier steps:
- Exploring the data.
  - Cleaning the data.
  - Engineering new features.
