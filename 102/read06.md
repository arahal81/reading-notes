## FUNCTIONS JS

### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 
### If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you canreuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).

* To create function " function function_Name() {the statements that perform the task} ".
* To call a function " function_Name(); ".
* To create function taking parameters " function function_Name(parameter1,parameter2...) {the statements that perform the task} ".
* To call a function taking parameters "function_Name(value1, value2......); "
* To getting a singel value out of a function " 
    function function_Name(parameter1,parameter2 ) 
    {
        var sum = parameter1+parameter2;
        return sum;

    }  "

## Colors CSS

* Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able  to read your content).
* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
